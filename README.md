# Binary ECG Classification (Normal vs Abnormal)

This project contains the complete work completed so far for binary ECG beat classification using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

## Project Goal

Train and evaluate a model that classifies each heartbeat into:
- `0`: Normal beat
- `1`: Abnormal beat

This folder is intentionally scoped to binary classification only.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. Place/keep the MIT-BIH raw dataset in `data/raw/mit-bih-arrhythmia-database-1.0.0/`.
2. Build the processed binary dataset:

	 ```powershell
	 cd src
	 python build_dataset.py
	 ```

3. Train and evaluate the random forest model:

	 ```powershell
	 python train_random_forest.py
	 ```

4. Review artifacts:
- Model file in `models/random_forest_binary.joblib`
- Confusion matrix image in `outputs/confusion_matrix.png`

## What Is Included So Far

- Data loading and preprocessing utilities
- Binary dataset generation (`X.npy`, `y.npy`)
- Random forest training and evaluation
- Class distribution and annotation exploration scripts

## Scope Boundary

This folder is the stable baseline for binary normal-vs-abnormal detection.

Any next phase (for example, multi-class arrhythmia case prediction) should be created as a separate sibling project folder to keep experiments and artifacts isolated.
